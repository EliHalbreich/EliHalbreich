I am currently an undergraduate student studying Psychology at Tufts University. I am a research assistant in Dr. Megan Mueller's [Tufts Pets and Well-Being (TPAW) Lab](https://sites.tufts.edu/tpawlab/) and for the [Tufts Institute for Human-Animal Interaction (TIHAI)](https://hai.tufts.edu/). I am also the research coordinator for the [Children's Television (CTV) Project](https://sites.tufts.edu/ctvresearch/). At Tufts, I have been working on research related to effects of dogs on applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapy sessions, the impact of pet dogs on adolescents with social anxiety, and and the effects of dogs on the activity levels of children.

I am broadly interested in the impact that companion animals have on the humans that live with them. Specifically, I am interested in the impact of emotional attachment to animals and attitudes toward animals on mental health and well-being.

In my spare time, I enjoy running, baking, and watching baseball (Dodgers) as well as soccer (Eintracht Frankfurt, LAFC).
