I am a Clinical Psychology Ph.D. Student at [Texas Tech University](https://www.ttu.edu/), where I study human-animal interaction in [Dr. Jason Van Allen's](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/psy/people/jvanallen/) Examining Nutrition, Exercise, and Rest in Growing Youth (ENERGY) Lab. I graduated with a BA in Psychology from [Tufts University](https://www.tufts.edu/) in 2022, where I studied human-animal interaction in Dr. Megan Mueller's [Tufts Pets and Well-Being Lab](https://sites.tufts.edu/tpawlab/) as well as at the [Tufts Initiative for Human-Animal Interaction](https://hai.tufts.edu/). Before transferring to Tufts, I was a student at [Los Angeles City College](https://www.lacitycollege.edu/) studying psychology.
