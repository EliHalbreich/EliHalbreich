I am an incoming Clinical Psychology Ph.D. Student at [Texas Tech University](https://www.ttu.edu/) who will be studying human-animal interaction in [Dr. Jason Van Allen's](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/psy/people/jvanallen/) Examining Nutrition, Exercise, and Rest in Growing Youth (ENERGY) Lab. I am finishing up my BA in Psychology at [Tufts University](https://www.tufts.edu/), where I study human-animal interaction. Before transferring to Tufts, I was a student at [Los Angeles City College](https://www.lacitycollege.edu/).
