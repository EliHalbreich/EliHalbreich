I am an incoming Clinical Psychology Ph.D. Student at [Texas Tech University](https://www.ttu.edu/), where I will be studying human-animal interaction in [Dr. Jason Van Allen's](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/psy/people/jvanallen/) Examining Nutrition, Exercise, and Rest in Growing Youth (ENERGY) Lab. I recently graduated with a BA in Psychology from [Tufts University](https://www.tufts.edu/), where I study human-animal interaction in Dr. Megan Mueller's [Tufts Pets and Well-Being Lab](https://sites.tufts.edu/tpawlab/) as well as for the [Tufts Initiative for Human-Animal Interaction](https://hai.tufts.edu/).
